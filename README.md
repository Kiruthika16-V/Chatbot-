# Chatbot-

I have developed a Multilingual Voice-Enabled Milk Adulteration Detection Chatbot 🥛🤖

This chatbot helps users check milk quality at home using lactometer and TDS meter readings. By entering these values, the chatbot:

1.Calculates the percentage of water dilution.
2.Identifies the possible adulterants mixed in milk.
3.Responds in both Tamil and English
Supports text and voice-based interaction.

The project focuses on food safety, user accessibility, and practical AI application, making milk quality analysis simple and understandable for everyone.
